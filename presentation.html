The idea for this tutorial came as Austin and I were looking at different solutions to ETL jobs that
our team.<br>
The intention is for developers that might be considering using these tools to get some more hands on experience<br>
with them. More than just reading a tutorial but experiment with writing DAGs for them, see things fail<br>
and fix them and have a feeling where these tools excel and where they come short.<br>
Also as many of you might be using Python frameworks as we do these tools will be a natural fit.<br>

Have some additional time to do this.<br>
The tutorial is split into two sections. In each section we will present the engine we are working with.<br>
We will then have a series of lessons where in each lesson we will cover some theory and then you can practice<br>

                <li>Not for data streaming</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
It was developed originally by Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb. History: started in 2014, brought to Airbnb github in 2015.<br>
Moved to Apache incubation (currently) in 2016.<br>
By Authoring DAGs using python you will get great flexibility. With that Airflow gives you many features such as rich UI and scheduling tools.<br>
As we will see was designed with multiple components that enable it to be very scalable and stable.<br>
This is not a data streaming solution (Spark streaming, storm), similar solutions are Pinball, Oozie, Azkaban, and Luigi.

                <li>Workers</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
Airflow UI is a Flask application that is used to display, monitor and control our DAG execution.<br>
Metadata database is used to store information about the current state of DAGs and tasks to facilitate UI presentation and scheduler operation<br>
The scheduler is a python process that runs and is used to schedule DAG and tasks runs.<br>
The executor is a component tightly coupled to the scheduler and triggers units of work on the workers. You can have local vs. celery executes.<br>
The worker actually execute the python code that was defined.

                Download and follow instructions at: TODO<br>
                Verify all components of Airflow are working and you can run the sample DAG.<br>
